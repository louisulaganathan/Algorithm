DataStructures:
==============
<br/>Array:
======
<br/> Most basic DS & linear DS
<br/> Collection of elements are allocated contiguous memory. Due to which any element of an array can be accessed in constant time.
<br/>Functionalites:
<br/>Reversing
<br/>Rotation
<br/>Rearrange
<br/>Range
<br/>Multidimentional

<br/>String:
=======
<br/>String is like an array type. last char will be null to represent the end of string
<br/>
<br/>Functionalities:
<br/>Subsequence or substring
<br/>Reverse & Rotation
<br/>Binary string - string formed using two type of chars.A binary string is a string that only has two characters, usually the numbers 0 and 1, and it represents a series of binary digits.
<br/>Palindrome - Chars are at the same distance from center
<br/>Pattern searching

<br/>LinkedList:
=============

<br/> LL is also a linear DS. unlike array it will be stored in random memory. Each node has data part and address part which holds address to next node.
<br/> LL should be created using custom type class
```
public class Node
{
    //Data part
    public string data;
    //Pointer - address part
    public Node next;
}
```
<br/>Single
<br/>Circular  -Last node points to the Head of LL
<br/>Double  - Each node has two pointers. 1- previous node 2- next node [web browser[next previous], undo & redo]
